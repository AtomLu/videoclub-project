## Summary


In this project I have worked with 7 different csv fields :
- films
- inventory
- actors
- rentals
- old hdd
- category
- languages


Each of this fields I have imported and cleanned in order to get them ready to be uploaded on sql. There is a field call " VIDEOCLUB" which contains all the proccess related to uploading fields from jupyter notebook to SQL. Once the tables which are collections in SQL you can write as many queries as you want in order to extract some conclusions from the data.
